# Meal-time
This was a mini project set by Harvard Univeristy Cs50 Introduction to Programing with Python course.

Suppose that you’re in a country where it’s customary to eat breakfast between 7:00 and 8:00, lunch between 12:00 and 13:00, and dinner between 18:00 and 19:00. This program tells the user what to eat base on their time.

This is a program that prompts a user for a time and outputs whether it’s breakfast time, lunchtime, or dinner time, depending on the real world time at the users current location.
